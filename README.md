I am a Data Scientist with a strong focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and extensive experience in developing and implementing machine learning models. My expertise includes working with state-of-the-art technologies in various NLP fields such as ChatBots, Question Answering, Summarization, and more.

- Implemented topic modeling for audit texts

## Projects 
### A RAG-based digital assistant for customer support
In this project, I developed an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot that integrates a Knowledge Base (KB) with a powerful Large Language Model (LLM). The implementation leveraged Ollama and Langchain for LLM calling and KB implamantations. I applied prompt engineering techniques to improve the quality of interactions with the LLM, ensuring the chatbot's responses were coherent and precise. I incorporated a re-ranker mechanism that prioritizes the most pertinent information from the Knowledge Base before generating the final response. The project also employed a Vector Database (ChromaDB) to efficiently manage and retrieve high-dimensional data, crucial for the real-time processing capabilities of the chatbot.
